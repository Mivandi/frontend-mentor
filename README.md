## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this repository.

This repository contains the projects that I practice to enhance front-end web development skills before applying for a job as a real web developer. This means the code can sometimes be buggy, ugly and / or look stupid. Feel free to provide me with feedback and tips!
